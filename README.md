# CI/CD Pipeline for Automated Configuration Deployment

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of configuration files to VyOS devices using Docker, GitLab, and Ansible.

## Tech Stack
- **Docker**: Used to containerize the Ansible environment for consistent automation.
- **GitLab**: Provides version control and CI/CD to automate the deployment process.
- **Ansible**: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool to manage and deploy configuration files to VyOS devices.
- **VyOS**: The target device (router) where the configuration will be deployed.
